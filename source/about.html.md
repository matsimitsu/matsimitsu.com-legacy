## This blog

I believe this is the 5th incarnation of this site, but the core concept has always been the same to write about my travels as they happen, so I can enjoy them again at a later date.

It started when I was planning my first trip to Japan and was looking for inspiration. I stumbled upon two websites [http://15daysinjapan.com/](http://15daysinjapan.com/) and [http://19daysinjapan.com/](http://19daysinjapan.com/) that showed beautifull images and stories written in a daily blog style. Later on I found [https://paulstamatiou.com/](https://paulstamatiou.com/) that does the same, but takes it to a higher level with his design skills. I really enjoyed reading the stories and the photos and decided to the same from then on.

At the end of every day on holiday I empty my camera and quickly pick the best photos to upload them over night (Internet isn't always the best in hotels). I write the posts every night so I don't forget what happened that day. Especially on long trips the days start to blend together and it becomes hard to remember what you did each day.

It took a few years of convincing but my travel buddy [started to do the same](https://travel.onnogroen). Other sites I recommend in this category are [https://akanekinomoto.com/](https://akanekinomoto.com/) and [https://mutelife.com/](https://mutelife.com/)

## What's in my bag

My first real camera was a **Nikon D50** with a kit-lens and a Nikon 70-300. It didn’t take long before it was replaced with a **Nikon D90** with a **Tamron 28-75** and a **Nikon 10-47** which was my favourite lens combination for a very long time.

After a few years I noticed that I would miss shots, because I didn’t want to take out the “big” camera, or it took too long to take it out and set it up.

The [Peak Design Capture clip](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/capture) helped a bit, but having a full-size DSLR on your belt or in front of your backpack all day long became cumbersome.

The D90 was one of the first camera’s with a video mode in 1080 resolution, but as with many first-time devices, it wasn’t very good. This lead me to buy a **Sony RX10** when I [was in Japan](https://matsimitsu.com/trips/asia-2014). It could fit in a jacket pocket for easy access.

While a great little camera that produced very nice photo’s, the lack of a viewfinder was becoming more and more annoying, especially on sunny days where you couldn’t see anything on the screen. Years of abuse started to [take its toll](https://matsimitsu.com/blog/2018-04-08-fix-rx100-startup-issue/) on the camera, it was always in my bag, with keys and other metal objects.

At this point the D90 was starting to show its age, especially in night-time conditions or indoors. Someone made me an offer on the old camera with lenses and I sold the entire set, replacing it with a **Sony A6000** (bought in the exact same shop in Tokyo as the RX100 [a few years later](http://localhost:4567/trips/asia-2017)).

The kit-lens was okay, but I wanted a better image quality, so I took a good look at all my photo’s in Lightroom and discovered that most of the photo’s were made in a few very specific ranges. (12-14) and (28-35), this lead me to buy the much praised **Samyang 14mm f/2.8** and the **Sigma 30mm F/1.4**. With these two primes and the kit-lens for other occasions I have all the coverage I need for the kind of photo’s I take.

This setup has stayed the same for the last few years, for me it has the perfect combination of range and quality in a compact package. It only takes up a small portion of my **Boundary Supply** [prima system backpack.](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/prima-system).

## This site

I've [blogged](/blog/2019-01-27-blog-update/) about my change back to a static site a little while ago. This site is a so called "static site" generated by [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com) a Ruby static site generator.

It's served by [netlify](https://netlify.com) an awesome (free) static site hosting company. The images and videos are served by **Amazon Cloudfront**, as the site would become too big to serve with Netlify, there's a 1GB limit and the (non-resized) photo's alone are ten times that right now.

You can find the source-code of this site on [GitHub](https://github.com/matsimitsu/matsimitsu.com).
