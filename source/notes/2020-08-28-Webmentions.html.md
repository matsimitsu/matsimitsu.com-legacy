# Webmentions

Added [webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to my blog with the help of [webmention.io](https://webmention.io) made by [Aaron Parecki](https://aaronparecki.com).

You can see an example here: [Resize images from s3 with AWS Lambda and Rust](https://matsimitsu.com/blog/2019-03-09-resize-images-from-s3-with-aws-lambda-and-rust#webmentions).

I used [brid.gy](https://brid.gy) to collect tweets that mention my article and have them send the data to [webmention.io](https://webmention.io), which exposes a JSON feed that I can use when building my blog. Pretty neat!
