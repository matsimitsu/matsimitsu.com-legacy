<h1>🎥 A Taxi Driver (Korean)</h1>

<p>I've been enjoying Korean movies/drama's lately and this one I can recommend to anyone, it's one of those movies you'll think about for a few days after.</p>

<p>It has a 96% 🍅 fresh rating on Rotten tomatoes and features Song Kang-ho as the lead actor, who you might recognise from Parasite, Memories of Murder or Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (all great movies). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>May, 1980. Man-seob is a taxi driver in Seoul who lives from hand to mouth, raising his young daughter alone. One day, he hears that there is a foreigner who will pay big money for a drive down to Gwangju city. Not knowing that he’s a German journalist with a hidden agenda, Man-seob takes the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The movie is based on events that happened during the 1980 Gwangju Uprising and besides a slightly condensed timeline follows the events that happened during that time faithfully. It's also a nice introduction to Korean history that happened after the Korean war, but before modern Korea. </p>
