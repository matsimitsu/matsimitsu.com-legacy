# Boundary Supply Prima system support

A couple of years ago I bought a [Boundary Supply Prima system](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/prima-system) backpack which has been traveling with me to many countries. 

Unfortunately the puller attachments came off one by one over the years, making the bag a bit tricky to open sometimes. 

The bag was sold with a lifetime guarantee, time to put that to the test :) 

After a quick chat with their support a few weeks ago, they sent me replacement puller attachments for free to the Netherlands, awesome!
