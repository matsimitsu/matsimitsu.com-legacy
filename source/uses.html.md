## Hardware

* **[Macbook Pro 2020 13"](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/).** One of the worst MacBooks I've ever had the pleasure of owning. It gets hot and drains the battery at random moments (nothing in activity monitor). USB-C stops working at random moments (won't charge, nor detect new devices plugged in) and the touchpad is horrible to use in warm weather/with sweatty hands. I wish I'd never given away my 2013 MacBook Pro 13".
* **[Keychron K1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard.** A good replacement for the legacy Apple keyboard that stopped working after one too many coffee spills. It's mechanical, but low profile.
* **[Logitech G502](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g502-hero-gaming-mouse.html) mouse.** A gamer mouse with weights you can add... Don't really care about that, but it fits nicely in my hand.
* **[LG 34wn80c](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34wn80c-b-ultrawide-monitor) curved 34" wide-screen monitor.** Uses USB-C and can charge my MacBook, only one cable is connected to my MacBook and I have power, screen and a USB hub that connects my mouse and keyboard. It has room for many terminal splits which is amazing.
* **[Herman Miller Mirra (V1)](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_eur/products/seating/office-chairs/mirra-2-chairs/) office chair.** Bought the (refurbished V1's) from my old job and now have 2, one at home and one at the office. One of the best chairs I've owned and they are still as new, while being more than eight years old.

One of the best chairs I've owned and they are still as new, while being more than eight years old.
* **[Xiaomi Mi4i](https://www.mi.com/in/mi4i/) phone.** It's cheap (150 euro's), it still lasts two days on a single charge after two years and still gets updates, because of Android One.
* **[Boundary Supply Prima System](https://www.boundarysupply.com/products/prima-system) backpack to carry it all.** A nice backpack that has a camera insert for photograpy gear that can be removed if it isn't needed. Plenty of space for daily groceries and a separate sleeve compartment for the laptop and documents.

## Software

* **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is my text editor of choice.** It all started with [Textmate](https://macromates.com) (first seen by me in the famous [15 minute blog video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY&feature=youtu.be) by DHH and the reason for buying Mac). Next was [Sublime text 2](https://www.sublimetext.com/2) and finally VS code with the [RailsCasts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PaulOlteanu.theme-railscasts) color theme that I've been using since Textmate times.
* **[Iterm2](https://iterm2.com).** The terminal that had tabs before the native OSX terminal had them. Never stopped using it. I use the default zsh "robbyrussell" theme.
* **[iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).** For taking notes in Markdown and writing blogposts / documentation and work/personal todo's.
* For work I mostly have the [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com) and [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-nl/) apps open. [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com) is used for personal communication with friends and family. Other tools used for work are [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and [CocoaRestClient](https://mmattozzi.github.io/cocoa-rest-client/). Suprisingly how few apps I have on this MacBook now that I think of it.
