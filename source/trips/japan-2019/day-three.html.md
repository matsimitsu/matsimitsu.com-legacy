We had to get up "early" and headed to the nearby 7-Eleven to get lunch we could eat on the mountain. From there we took multiple trains to Mt. Takao.

[location: Mount Takao, Japan]

A number of trails were closed due to typhoon damage. This meant we had to take the cable-car up the mountain and from there we could start our hike around the mountain.

Near the top are a number of Temples/Shrines and from the top you can take a couple of trails to other mountain tops, or back to the cable car.

We spent a couple of hours navigating a few trails on the mountain, hardly passing anyone on the way, it was really beautifull and quiet.

What wasn't so quiet was the street in front of the Okonomiyaki place near Shinjuku station. The food was really good though!
