The weather forecast wasn't great and when we stepped outside of the hotel it was raining extremely hard. Even armed with umbrella's our legs were soaked in minutes. This meant we had to find indoor stuff to do.

[location: Teamlab Borderless, Tokyo, Japan]

Luckily Tokyo had us covered and we went to the Teamlab Borderless exhibition. I was there last year as well, but I don't mind going again, it's still as amazing as the first time.
