One of the "main" public attractions we missed two years ago were the mid-level escalators. A set of escalators from the bay up into the hills. In total it takes about 20 minutes to ride all escalators to the "top". If this doesn't sound exciting I don't know what does!

This is where the airconditioners live

Once at the top we had to make our way back down (the escalators only go one way),

Partly built in the mountains, Hong Kong is a maze of elevated roadways with "Jungle" below.

Once we were back down we took the subway to our next destination, Mong Kok where supposedly there was a secret back alley with tons of graffiti.

Walking around in Hong Kong you have to be careful not to walk under leaking airconditioners.

Thanks to an excellent guide we found our way to the alley. In the alley there were a couple of groups creating photo's for the latest streatwear. Looks like we're finally one of the cool kids ;)

Not everyone approved.

It was round lunchtime, so we headed back into the heart of Mong Kok in search for food.

After lunch we headed to Nan Lian Garden.

For some reason the route to the Sha Tin Racecourse was not posted anywhere so we took a wrong turn somewhere and it took us a good 45 minutes to backtrack and head the right way. This left us just in time to see the very last race of the day, all I could manage this this photo :(
