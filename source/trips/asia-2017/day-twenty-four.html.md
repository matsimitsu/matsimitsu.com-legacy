The last two days were kind of rough with stomach issues and having to wake up at 0300 to catch a flight to Brunei, but we finally made it.

After a quick nap at the hotel we set out to explore the neighbourhood. Since it was Ramadan, most of the restaurants were closed. (Brunei is in the process of implementing sharia law, that means you can't be seen eating or drinking during the day).

At nightfall we set out again (hoping that the temperatures would have dropped a bit) in search of a restaurant.

With dinner over and still tired from the early wakeup we headed back to the hotel.
