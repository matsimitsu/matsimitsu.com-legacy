After a comfertable first class train ride to Surabaya we took the bus to Malang. The next day at 00:00 in the evening we had a tour planned to Mt. Bromo. With that in mind we took a small, easy trip to a few tourist spots in Malang.

Kampung Warna- Warni, better known as Jodipan Village used to be a run-of-the-mill village near the main train station of Malang.

Eight college students of Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang (UMM) have changed this village by colouring the villlage with different colours around the environment.

After the colourful village, we decided to walk back to the hotel instead of taking an Uber, just to see the city. We came across city hall and from there wandered around untill we got back at the hotel.
