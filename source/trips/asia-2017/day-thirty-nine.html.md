After the [USA roadtrip](http://localhost:4567/travel/usa2014/day-five-six/) a few years ago where we visited Universal Studios Orlando we wanted to see how Japan stacked up, so we headed for Universal Studios Japan. We bought tickets on the official website with the help of Google translate. This way we were able to purchase Express passes, as they were sold out on 3rd party sites.

The park was not too busy and in theory we could have done without the passes, we managed to do all rides at least once, but it's nice to skip a 1.5 hour queue every once in a while :)

This was the last day of this adventure, Tomorrow we fly back to Amsterdam and then it's back to planning the next trip.
