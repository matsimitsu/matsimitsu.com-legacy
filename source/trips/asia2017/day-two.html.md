## On our way

It's 07:00 when my alarm goes of, time to get up and head to the airport where I"ll be flying to Tokyo through Helsinki with Finnair and Japan Airlines.

After arriving in Narita airport a good 15 hours later, I headed to my hotel and set out to get the basic trip supplies such as a data simcard and coffee in Ikebekuro a few train stops away from my hotel.
