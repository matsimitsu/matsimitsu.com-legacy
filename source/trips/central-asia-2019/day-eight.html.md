Our train leaves at 15:50 in the afternoon, which means we have half a day to spend in Bukhara. We chose to visit a few sites outside the city with a hired driver to fill the time. He'd drop us off at the station at the end of the "tour".


[location: Chor Bakr, Bukhara, Uzbekistan]

First up was Chor Bakr Necropolis, the burial place of "Abu-Bakr-Said", one of the descendants of Muhammad.

When we were wandering around a man approached us and asked if we would like to climb the mosque to get a better view, for just 10.000 SOM per person. We thought sure, why not and were guided to a staircase and told to have fun. We could walk around everywhere, even up to the edge on the roof.

[location: Bukhara 1, Kogon, Uzbekistan]

Near the station was an old palace, build for a king that never moved in so it was repurposed as a train station. It's surrounded by the obligatury Soviet era fun-fare. The Bukhara-1 train station is not actually located in Bukhara, but in a town near the city called Kogon. Bukhara-2 is a train station that _is_ located in the city, but is freight only.
