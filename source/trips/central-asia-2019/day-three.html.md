A continuation from day two, since we landed around 05:40 in the morning in Bishkek. We wanted to make the most of the day and decided not to sleep, but instead hike around Ala Archa National Park.

While this seems weird, we had two reasons **one:** we only have two days here, so sleeping for a day would not be great.
And **two:** sleeping during the day would only make it more difficult to get rid of the Jetlag.

We explored the hotel neighbourhood in search for an ATM and a supermarket, both were around the corner and booked a driver to take us to the park and back.

We were planning to hike to a waterfall, and it starts a good way into the park. On the internet we read about people who were dropped off at the beginning of the park, taking 2-3 hours just to get to the start of the 3 hour hike.

Well that also happened to us, despite explicitly asking to drop us off at the start of the hike to both the Hotel clerk and the driver.

It started to dawn on us about half an hour into the hike and after a few "lets just check this corner", we took our losses and headed back. The scenery was still amazing, and so was the weather so it wasn't a loss, just not what we had planned.
