After the first good night of sleep on the trip we were well rested for today. The plan is to wander around Khiva some more untill we have to go to the train station to catch the train to Bukhara.

We start by getting some snacks for on the train and then make our way to the wall around the city. There are a few entry points and none have signs that it's forbidden to go on the wall, so we go :)

Breakfast was nice, but it's after noon so time for some lunch. We pick a random place in a park near the inner city and get a wrap filled with meat, tomatos and other vegetables. After lunch we visit a few other museums in the city.

We are in car 4 out of 16 and it's quite a walk to the other end. Our cabin seats two people and is considered "first class". Second and third class cabins look the same, but with more beds stacked agains the wall.
