After a good night's sleep (we went to bed at 21:00) we were ready for a new day. It's time to explore Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. Luckily for us all the touristy things are centered in a few blocks.

[location: Ala Too Square, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan]

The main square in the city is Ala Too Square. Walking up to the square we were stopped by the "Tourist Police" who asked us about our stay in the country and if we had any problems they could help with, very friendly.

It's not a touristy city which is great for my "As few people in the picture as possible" since there were only two other people here.

One block over is the "Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic".

[location: Oak Park, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan]

From the Parliament we wrapped around the block to the back, where found Oak Park. An amusement park with many attractions.

One of them was a ferris wheel, which we took to get a nice overview of the city. Unfortunately it was too clouded to get a good view of the mountains in the distance.

As a Roller Coaster enthusiast we just had to ride one of the few coasters in Kyrgyzstan. Because we were the only ones, the operator let us do four laps.

Tucked away behind a museum is an old statue of Lenin, it used to stand on the spot where the horse is at the beginning of this post. Spread out through the park with the Lenin statue where some other Soviet Union Relics.

Walking to the next attraction we came across some very unique buildings, one of which is a Circus, we think.

[location: Victory Square, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan]

The next attraction is Victory Square, a monument to the victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war.

![DSC09430.jpg](https://d3khpbv2gxh34v.cloudfront.net/r/central-asia-2019/day-four/DSC09430.jpg "1.5")

Our idea was to visit a hotel behind the square to take a nice photo with the mountains in the background, but it was still too cloudy to get a good view.

We stopped for a quick lunch, which we thought was a small wrap, but turned out to be quite the meal. After lunch we headed to the last destination of our trip. A, what we thought to be, beautiful park.

The park turned out to be quite different from the pictures on Google. It was supposed to be a swimming pond, but the water was kind of missing...
