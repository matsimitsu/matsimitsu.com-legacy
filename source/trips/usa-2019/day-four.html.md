The jet-lag was still on our side, everyone woke up at seven in the morning. This meant an early departure for Monument Valley, resulting in plenty of time in the park.

Monument valley is what people think of when they imagine the American west. It's featured in many movies and the road leading up to the park is beautiful.

There's a dirt road leading throughout the park that you can drive with your car. A good time to test the off-road capabilities of our rental car ;)

The views throughout the park are amazing with new rock formations around every corner.
