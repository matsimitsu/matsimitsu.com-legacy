At exactly 07:55 my brother arrived to take us to the airport. Almost four hours before the flight departs, but with an estimated 200.000 passengers leaving Schiphol Airport today we took a bit of leeway.

The check-in process and security was very smooth and we could spend some time at the airport bar before boarding or Boeing 787 to Las Vegas.

After arriving and making it through immigration we headed to the Rental car place to pick up our car for the next few weeks and headed to the hotel.

Most of us were tired after the flight, so we did a quick tour of part of the strip and headed to the hotel for a good night of sleep.

The next day we woke up really early (Jetlag) and after a nice breakfast at Denny's we headed to Wallmart for supplies such as a cooler and drinks for on the road.

The rest of the day was spent relaxing in the shade at the pools our hotel had to offer, waiting for the sun to stop burning us alive so we could see the rest of the strip.

In the evening we headed for dinner, but not before stopping at Dave and Busters for some arcade time. We then headed for the strip to see the Bellagio water show.
