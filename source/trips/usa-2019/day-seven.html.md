We had no real plan today, other than to head to Zion National Park, which was an hour or so away from the hotel.

[location: Zion National Park, Utah, USA]

During breakfast we decided to not do the "Angels Landing" hike, that pretty much everyone does, but to take another hike on the opposite side of the park.

The description said it would take about 3 hours to complete and it's a total of 12 Kilometers.

The hike is not really difficult, but the 30+ degrees weather and full sunshine makes a lot harder.

You are rewarded with amazing views over the park at the end. We enjoyed it with a late lunch and after a few more photo's we headed back to the car to head to St. George where we will stay the night.
