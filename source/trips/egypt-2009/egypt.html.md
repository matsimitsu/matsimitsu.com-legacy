I must admit, that I don't have a great recollection of this trip. But I do know it was the second, and last time I booked an all-inclusive-resort holiday. Most of the time was spent around the resort, lying on the beach and going on diving trips. But we did spend two days outside Hurgada.

The first day outside was a daytrip to Luxor, where we visited the Luxor temple and the Valley of the Kings. The day started early as we piled into a minivan that would take us to Luxor. Along the way there were many military checkpoints and a not-so-clean reststop, which featured a donkey with a goat on it's back.

[location: Luxor, Egypt]

In Luxor we headed straight to the Luxor temple. It was morning still, but already really hot and sunny.

The site was pretty crowded and everyone was trying to stay in the shadows, the sights were amazing though.

After a couple of laps through the complex we headed to the river to get lunch and a boatride to the other side.

[location: Valley of the Kings, Egypt]

After lunch we headed to the Valley of the kings, one of the hottest places on earth. It sure felt like it.

For some reason I can't find any photo's of us inside the tombs, but I did find one where I'm posing next to this nice security guard.

[location: Hurghada, Egypt]

On the second day we went outside of the resort we joined a "Quad tour" out in the desert.

We stopped at a remote village where they showed us how the people live(d).

After the obligatory camel ride the evening started to set in and we enjoyed the sunset above the village and headed back to our resort in the dark.
