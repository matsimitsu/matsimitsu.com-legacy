With a sunny day ahead we headed to our first location, the Martyr’s Shrine. We had quite a walk ahead, as the site was well away from any metro stations.

The shrine houses the spirit tablets of about 390,000 persons killed, among other engagements, during the Xinhai Revolution, Northern Expedition, Second Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Civil War, and the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises.

When we arrived we noticed multiple tourbusses in front of the Shrine. Loads of Chinese tourist where herded inside to see the changing of the guards. Looks like we got there just in time! (Most photos you see here are about 30 minutes later, when all the other touristes where back in their busses.)

On our way to the Confucius Temple we came across the Museum of Fine Art. There was only one exhibition open, but it was only 40 Eurocents and it had Airconditioning so we went inside. The exhibition was about [Heatherwick Studio](http://www.heatherwick.com/), designers of the new London Bus.

It was crowded, hot and smokey, but nice to see.
