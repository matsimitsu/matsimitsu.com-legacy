After 10 hours in the train we finally arrived at Sa Pả around half past five in the morning. From there we got a private car to our hotel for a quick shower and breakfast. We were ready for the first trek.

What started out as a relatively cold morning (21 degrees) soon changed to the same heat we had this entire trip.

The trek itself was pretty nice, but _very_ touristy, every couple of meters there's a shop selling bracelets, cloth or drinks. I had to try very hard not to get too much touristy stuff on these photo's.
