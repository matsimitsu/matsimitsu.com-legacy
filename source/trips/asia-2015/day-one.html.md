Finally, after 17 hours of traveling we've arrived at our hotel in Singapore. Since it's 20:00 in the evening and we're up for 30+ hours, today is going to be short. We visited one of the Hawker centre, a covered square of food stalls and ate some delicous Hainanese fried rice.

After dinner it's back to the hotel for the first good night's sleep.
