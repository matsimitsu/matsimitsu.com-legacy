Today we decided to visit a Japanese themepark called Nagashima Spa land. It has 11 Rollercoasters packed into a tiny area.

The main attraction is the Steel Dragon 2000. It tops out at 153 Km/h and takes around four minutes. The first hill is almost 100 meters tall. (For the Dutch readers, Goliath in Walibi is half that height).

The rest of the day was spent trying out all the other coasters and rides. Because we visited on a monday there were almost no queue's and most of the time we could step right into the cars.
