Yet again we had to get up super early (05:00) to catch the first subway to the airport. Here we got on a packed boeing 777 to Tokyo, Japan! 


When we arrived it was raining, but that didn't matter we were tired from the short night and decided to take it easy. 


In the evening we walked around the neighbourhood of our hotel in Shinjuku.

It was about time for dinner, and after we headed up to the lounge deck of our hotel.
