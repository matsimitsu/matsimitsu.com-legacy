It's the last day already on this trip and with a beautiful day forecasted I headed to the edge of the city again, this time to do a [3-mountain hike](https://en.japantravel.com/saitama/hiwada-takashi-monomi-mtn-trail/8541).

There was no map of the route so I had to go by written text only and it was quite sparse at some points, but I managed to find the start of the route and it went uphill immidiately. After a good climb I was greeted with the first views.

It was a clear day and you could see the highrises of downtown Tokyo in the distance.

The route passes through beautifull forests and there was hardly anyone there.

I had no issues finding the route markers.

Eventually the trail took me down the mountains and I ended up a station over from the starting point, from where I took the train back to Tokyo.
