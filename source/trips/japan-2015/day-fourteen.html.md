The weather forecast only predicted rain today, so it was time for an indoor activity. Relatively close by there was a Train Museum that was highly recommended on TripAdvisor.

They had many trains on display and made sure you can take a peek inside every one of them. There also were a few train simulators and tons of interactive displays of the inner workings. The only downside was that everything was in Japanese.

With the rain still pooring down, but still a few hours left in the day I decided to head to Kawagoe where there's a street with traditional Japanese houses.

By this time the rain was getting even worse and within minutes I was completely soaked. Time to cut this visit short and head to my "home town" of [Naka-Itabashi](https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/Naka-Itabashi+Station/@35.7684018,139.6736014,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x601892cdb140d503:0x21b9ca4d647f9f17?hl=en) and eat some delicious Sushi.
