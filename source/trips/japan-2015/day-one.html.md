Still jet-lagged I decided to sleep in and later headed to Akihabara Electric Town so I could get a Japanese (data) sim-card at the Yodabashi Camera store.

After receiving the sim-card I wandered around the area, surrounded by trains.

After a delicious bowl of noodles, I headed back to the hotel for more sleep. The last image is the view from my hotel room. It's surprisingly quiet, despite the highway right in front of my window.
