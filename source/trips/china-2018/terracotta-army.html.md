One of the must-do attractions in Xi'an is visiting the famous Terracotta Army, so that's what we did on this super sunny and hot Friday.

There are several buildings in the park, one of them is a museum showcasing dug up horses and carts. The other buildings cover pits where the artifacts were found.

The main attraction is a giant airplane hangar-like structure that covers the main pit.

While we were there, people were working on excavating more statues.
