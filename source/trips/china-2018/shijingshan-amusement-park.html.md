We've been traveling by train for the past two days from Xi'an to Beijing with a stopover in Shijiazhuang. Originally we wanted to visit a temple in the mountains near Shijiazhuang, but what sounds like a good idea in your living room is not always something you want to do after almost 3 weeks of travel.

It would have taken us three hours of travel by bus each way and another hour to climb the mountain to basically take a single photo and we decided this wasn't worth it. Instead we changed our train tickes from 20:00 in the evening to 10:00 in the morning so we could spend more time in Beijing.

Our hotel in Beijing is right next to a amusement park. Their motto is "Disney is too far to go, please come to Shijingshan!", so we took some time to check it out.

At first glance the park looks nice. It's only 10 Yuan to enter (~ 1.20 euro) and you pay for each ride.

There were almost no visitors, weird on a Sunday afternoon.

After a closer look, you can clearly see that the park's best days are in the past.

Many rides were closed or even missing.

Out of the 3 rides called "Wild Mouse" exactly 0 were operating. 

![5b01388a2a86920215035654](https://d3khpbv2gxh34v.cloudfront.net/p/china-2018/shijingshan-amusement-park/5b0138922a86920215035656.jpg "1.5")

One of the better themed water rides was in the process of beeing torn down.

It felt weird walking through the park parts of it looked fine and there were plenty of rides still operating, though most were variants of spinning rides you see at carnivals.

There was even a brand-new ferris wheel

Eventually we took the gamble and purchased a couple of tickets for the only still operating roller coaster...

... and we survived!
