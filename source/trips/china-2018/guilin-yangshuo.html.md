With the alarm set at 07:00 in the morning this was one of the hardest days to wake up to. At exactly eight o clock the driver was waiting in front of our hotel to take us to the boat dock for our cruise. While we were in the car it was still raining and very foggy, we hoped the rain would clear up during the day.

After a Chinese-only safety briefing and a cup of tea we were allowed to visit the top deck of the boat. The view from there was amazing.

Around every bend of the river there were even more gorgeous views.

It took some creativity to get the photos we wanted though, as it was quite busy on the top-deck.

After an okay meal on board we arrived at our destination, the city of Yangshuo, where a really nice hotel waited for us.
