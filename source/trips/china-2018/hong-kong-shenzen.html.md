Today is the day we cross into mainland China and see if our visum works. We started with breakfast and a last quick walk around the neighbourhood of our hotel. Then we packed our bags and headed to the ferry to cross the harbour into Kowloon to the train station.

The train takes about 30-40 minutes and you cross the border by foot. Then we had to dodge some shady taxi hustlers and took the subway to our hotel, which took a while as it was hidden in the city center. Settled in we wandered around the neighbourhood.

Right next to our hotel is a fairgrounds of some kind.

It was starting to get dark, time for dinner and hopefully a good nights's sleep.
