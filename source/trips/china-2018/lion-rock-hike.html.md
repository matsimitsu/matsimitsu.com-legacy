After visiting "Ocean World" yesterday we decided it was time to explore nature with a hike. Last year we did the "Dragon back trail" and this time we wanted to see the "Lion Rock peak". This meant taking the ferry to the other side of Kowloon Bay.

After crossing the bay we took the MTR to the start of our hike. When we exited the subway, we noticed a temple and since we haven't seen one yet this trip, we had to check it out.

After a delicious lunch at the near-by mall, we walked the final part to the Hike starting point, from there it was a steep incline to the top.

The weather was predicted as sunny, but that turned out not to be the case. The temperature was great though, at a nice 27 degrees and without the sun and a little breeze it was excellent hiking weather.

The trail rewards you every few hundred meters with great views of the Kowloon skyline.

Aparently things have gone wrong in the past, luckily for us, we approached this sign from the back side, negating any danger ;)

After this it went all down hill, passing underneath powerlines and eventually back at the city.
