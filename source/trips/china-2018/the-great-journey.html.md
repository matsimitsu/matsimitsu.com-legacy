Today was a day with lots of sitting on our butts in seats. First on a tuktuk to the  "bus station" then a bus to the train station.

From there we took a high-speed train to Changsha south railway station where we had to change to the subway to get to the other Changsha station.

From Changsha the "local" train to Zhangjiajie departed.

After 13+ hours we finally arrived at Zhangjiajie railway station. Luckily our hotel is located about 50 meters from the station entrance so no more modes of transport were needed.
